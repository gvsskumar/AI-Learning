🧩 What Is the __pycache__ Folder?
When you run a Python file (e.g. your FastAPI app), Python compiles it into bytecode — a lower-level, faster-to-load version of your .py file.
These compiled files are stored inside a folder called __pycache__.

# Folder Structured

│   ├── main.cpython-311.pyc
│   └── models.cpython-311.pyc

⚙️ Why Does Python Create It?
✅ Purpose: Speed up startup time.
When you run Python code again:
    It checks if a matching .pyc file already exists.
    If yes (and up-to-date), it loads the compiled bytecode instead of recompiling the .py file.
That’s all — purely a performance optimization.

❌ Is It Necessary?
Not necessary for your source code.
Safe to delete anytime.

If you delete it:
Python will automatically recreate it next time you run your app.
It doesn’t affect your actual code or FastAPI functionality.
