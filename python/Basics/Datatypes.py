#Fundamental Datatypes
#1. String
#2. Integer
#3. Float
#4. Boolean
#5. List
#6. Tuple
#7. Dictionary
#8. Set
#9. None

#1. String
str1 = "Hello World"
print(type(str1))


#2. Integer
num1 = 10
print(type(num1))


#3. Float
num2 = 3.14
print(type(num2))


#4. Boolean
bool1 = True
print(type(bool1))


#5. List
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(type(list1))


#6. Tuple
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(type(tuple1))


#7. Dictionary
dict1 = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(type(dict1))


#8. Set
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(type(set1))


#9. None
none1 = None
print(type(none1))

#Output:
#<class 'str'>
#<class 'int'>
#<class 'float'>
#<class 'bool'>

str1 = "10"
num1 = int(str1)
print(type(num1))

#Output:
#<class 'int'>

#2. Integer to String
num1 = 10
str1 = str(num1)
print(type(str1))

#Output:
#<class 'str'>

#3. String to Float
str1 = "3.14"
num1 = float(str1)
print(type(num1))

#Output:    
#<class 'float'>

#4. Float to String
num1 = 3.14
str1 = str(num1)
print(type(str1))

#Output:
#<class 'str'>

#5. String to Boolean
str1 = "True"
bool1 = bool(str1)
print(type(bool1))

#Output:
#<class 'bool'>

#6. Boolean to String
bool1 = True
str1 = str(bool1)
print(type(str1))

#Output:
#<class 'str'>

#7. Integer to Boolean
num1 = 1
bool1 = bool(num1)
print(type(bool1))

#Output:
#<class 'bool'>

#8. Boolean to Integer
bool1 = True
num1 = int(bool1)
print(type(num1))

#Output:
#<class 'int'>

#9. Float to Integer
num1 = 3.14
num2 = int(num1)
print(type(num2))

#Output:
#<class 'int'>

#10. Integer to Float
num1 = 10
num2 = float(num1)
print(type(num2))

#Output:
#<class 'float'>

#special datatypes
# 1. None
# 2. Ellipsis
# 3. NotImplemented
# 4. NotImplementedType
# 5. NotImplementedClass
# 6. NotImplementedInstance
# 7. NotImplementedSubclass
# 8. NotImplementedSubclassInstance

#None is used to represent an empty value or a null value in a variable. It is often used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value yet.

#Ellipsis is used to represent a placeholder in a sequence or a slice. It is often used to indicate that a sequence or slice is empty.

#NotImplemented is used to represent a method that has not been implemented yet. It is often used to indicate that a method has not been implemented yet.

#NotImplementedType is used to represent a type that has not been implemented yet. It is often used to indicate that a type has not been implemented yet.

#NotImplementedClass is used to represent a class that has not been implemented yet. It is often used to indicate that a class has not been implemented yet.

#NotImplementedInstance is used to represent an instance of a class that has not been implemented yet. It is often used to indicate that an instance of a class has not been implemented yet.      

#NotImplementedSubclass is used to represent a subclass of a class that has not been implemented yet. It is often used to indicate that a subclass of a class has not been implemented yet.

#Custom datatypes
#1. User-defined classes
#2. User-defined functions
#3. User-defined modules
#4. User-defined exceptions

#User-defined classes are user-defined data types that are created by the user. They are defined using the class keyword.

#User-defined functions are user-defined functions that are created by the user. They are defined using the def keyword.

#User-defined modules are user-defined modules that are created by the user. They are defined using the import keyword.

#User-defined exceptions are user-defined exceptions that are created by the user. They are defined using the raise keyword.
